Rewrite Post model system.
	- Better use of CPT to enable more customisation.
	- Only allow certain taxonomies and features dependent on CPT
	
Rewrite Term/Taxonomy system
	- Remove post category and tag models and replace with standardised term model
	- Maybe reinstate post category and tag models but just extend standard term model (for backwards compat)
	- Move category/feed block to term/feed
	- Add feeds for all terms
	
Remove Controllers
	- Remove Post/CustomtypeController.php
	- Remove Category and Tag controller, use TermController instead
	- Remove page controller
